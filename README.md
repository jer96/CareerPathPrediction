### Introduction

With the excess of career opportunities in our society, it has become increasingly difficult to choose the right career path. This is dubbed the paradox of choice where having more options causes individual to struggle when making decisions due to fear of making the wrong decision. Further, this indecisiveness causes a gap in the job market, filling jobs with individuals who are not passionate about their work causing decreased levels of productivity. Our mission, is to limit the range of choices for prospective professionals, giving them the opportunity to better understand career paths based on their work experience and the current education and job market.
